# Advanced-Machine-Learning-TDDE15
The course presents the analysis of several large classes of models widely used in advanced machine learning, such as state-space models, gaussian processes, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, and Markov random fields.

## Exams
Solved exams, including my own exam for 2020-11

## Lab 1 - Graphical Models
- Showed local optima convergence of hill climbing (network structure learning algorithm)
- Learnt a Bayesian Network over a dataset for lung diseases and visits to asia and symptoms.
- Reasoned and showed properties of markov blanket for predictions.

## Lab 2 - Hidden Markov Models
- Constructed and simulated from an HMM model for a robot traversing a circular path with an innacurate sensor with transition and emission matrixes.
- Computed smoothed and filtered probability distrubutions and most probable path (with Viterbi).
- Plotted entropy for filtered distrubution to reason about robot position information over time.

## Lab 3 - Reinforcment Learning
- Implemented greedy policy and epsilon-greedy policy
- Implemented Q-Learning algorithm
- Experimented with different environments and values for discount, learning rate, and randomization in the environments to study agent convergence

## Lab 4 - Gaussian Processes
- Implemented a fast algorithm for computation of posterior for a gaussian process by using Cholesky decomposition instead of matrix inversion.
- Implemented radial basis and periodic kernel. 
- Implemented a Gaussian Process Classifier for banknote fraud
